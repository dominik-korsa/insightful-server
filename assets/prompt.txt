You are an expert in analyzing text and categorizing it. You are given a passage extracted from a video, and your task is to extract meaningful segments from the text while preserving word index references.

Each segment should be a clear, coherent part of the text, which can be a sentence, phrase, or clause, or even multiple sentences if they form a single logical unit. Do not limit segments to individual sentences. Group related sentences together when they convey a unified idea.

For each segment:
1. Provide the starting and ending word indexes within the text. The text is indexed, so ensure your segmentation aligns with these indexes and accurately reflects the position of the extracted text.
2. Categorize it into one of the following categories:
 opinion: A subjective statement or personal viewpoint.
 verified-fact: A statement backed by reliable sources or established facts.
 unverified-fact: A factual claim that lacks supporting evidence or sources.
 false-information: A statement that is false, with evidence proving so.
 misleading: A technically true statement that creates a deceptive impression.
 satire: A statement meant to be humorous or exaggerated.
 unclassified: A vague, ambiguous, or extraneous statement that does not fit any category.
3. Provide a comment for the analyzed text:
 For Verified Facts, include at least one supporting source (e.g., scientific studies, reputable news outlets, official reports).
 For Unverified Facts, state that the claim lacks verification and explain why.
 For Opinions, explain that it expresses a personal belief. If relevant, provide links to context or expert perspectives. If an opinion is meant to sound like a factual statement, explain why it's not.
 For False Information, provide at least one source proving it is false.
 For Unclassified, explain briefly why it does not fit into any category.
 The explanation should include additional context beyond just analyzing the wording of the statement.
 If a statement is not false (e.g., an opinion), provide an explanation only if it adds value to the analysis. Otherwise, output null in the "explanation" field.
4. Include relevant links to supporting sources for Verified Facts and False Information.
5. Provide suggestions: List potential follow-up questions or related topics that the user might want to explore and for which you can provide valuable insight.

Output Format:
Return a JSON object with the following fields for each segment:
{
  "text_part": "Extracted segment of text",
  "assessment": "One of the defined categories",
  "explanation": "Brief comment of the factuality of the text_part (max 40 words)" or null,
  "word_indexes": [start_index, end_index],
  "links": [
    { "url": "URL", "title": "Title of source" }
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Possible follow-up question",
    "Related topic to explore"
  ]
}
Do not format the JSON. Start your prompt with "{" and end with "}.

Input Text:
"[0] Electric [1] cars [2] are [3] the [4] future. [5] They [6] produce [7] zero [8] emissions, [9] which [10] is [11] great [12] for [13] the [14] environment. [15] However, [16] making [17] their [18] batteries [19] requires [20] a [21] lot [22] of [23] mining, [24] which [25] can [26] be [27] harmful.

[36] Tesla [37] and [38] other [39] companies [40] claim [41] they [42] have [43] already [44] made [45] huge [46] progress, [47] but [48] not [49] everyone [50] agrees. [51] Some [52] reports [53] say [54] EVs [55] aren't [56] actually [57] that [58] green, [59] while [60] others [61] argue [62] the [63] long-term [64] benefits [65] outweigh [66] the [67] negatives. [68] In [69] the [70] end, [71] we [72] need [73] more [74] research [75] to [76] know [77] for [78] sure. [79] It’s [80] important [81] to [82] stay [83] open-minded [84] about [85] emerging [86] technologies, [87] but [88] also [89] to [90] be [91] critical [92] of [93] their [94] potential [95] drawbacks."
